		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Welcome to my website! I am a sophomore enrolled in the University of Michigan School of Literature, Science and Arts. Currently, I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Anthropology, with a minor in Asian Languages. Outside of academics, I have a broad range of interests. I am involved in an on-campus A Cappella group, <a class = "paragraph-link" href = "http://ummidnightblue.weebly.com">Midnight Blue</a>. Our concert theme for this semester is middle-school dance and I am so excited to perform all of these throwback songs! I also am very passionate about promoting the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiative, and am the secretary of MOSAIC, the Stockwell Hall Multicultural Council. I have recently become very interested in user-friendly design and have been working on creating several aesthetic portfolio pages for myself and my friends. I also have a passion for 3D design, animation, and research. I am a research assistant for the Department of Classical Studies, and am working on developing a <a class = "paragraph-link" href = "http://gabiiserver.adsroot.itcs.umich.edu/gabiigoesdigital/">three-dimensional virtual representation of an archaeological site outside of Rome, Italy. </a> In my free time, I enjoy watching anime (some of my favorites are Naruto, Hunter x Hunter, and Your Lie in April), playing Pokemon, reading (Check out my reading list <a>here</a>), exploring world cuisine, planning future adventures, making people laugh, and spending time with my family and friends.</p>
